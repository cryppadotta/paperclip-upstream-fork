/**
 * When the WYSIWYG blockquote shortcut does not fire (e.g. the `> ` prefix is
 * assembled by an edit that Lexical's markdown-shortcut transform doesn't catch,
 * which happens on some browsers/IMEs), MDXEditor exports the paragraph as an
 * *escaped* blockquote — `\> text`. `mdast-util-to-markdown` escapes a leading
 * `>` so a literal paragraph round-trips as text rather than a blockquote.
 *
 * In this product `>` at the start of a line always means "blockquote" (there is
 * no separate literal-`>` affordance and the composer has no blockquote toolbar
 * button), so an escaped `\>` is never the user's intent — it is a silently
 * dropped blockquote. This helper rewrites a leading `\>` back to `>` so the
 * stored markdown renders as the blockquote the user typed.
 *
 * Only a marker at the block-level line start is rewritten. The exporter escapes
 * a `>` exactly where CommonMark would otherwise start a blockquote — the first
 * column of a block, allowing the 0–3 spaces of insignificant indent. Restricting
 * to `^ {0,3}\>` deliberately skips:
 *   - indented code blocks (4+ spaces of indent), whose `\>` is literal content;
 *   - content nested in a blockquote or list, whose lines carry a `>`/`-`/`digit.`
 *     container prefix rather than plain indent.
 *
 * Top-level fenced code blocks are also skipped: their contents are never
 * `\`-escaped by the exporter, and a `\>` inside a code fence is meaningful
 * literal text. Fence tracking follows CommonMark: a closing fence must use the
 * same character as the opening fence, be at least as long, and carry no trailing
 * content (an info string is only allowed on the opening fence).
